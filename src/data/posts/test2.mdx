## Motivation

I use Obsidian to write my reflections, ideas, project planning, etc., but I wanted to be able to use it on the web.

That is why I’m building a similar web app to write on the web and sync my through all devices.

Features: Memoir uses TipTap: a library that subtracts the complexity of setting up a Prose Mirror editor while providing an already-written boilerplate. I have also worked on creating a system to save the document efficiently that doesn’t send requests constantly. 

It only saves the file after you have stopped typing for a few seconds. You can see the file status on the top bar. It also has support for Writing Markdown. 


It supports headings (the heading 1 is the file title) 

## heading 2 

### heading 3 

#### heading 4 

and it supports text styles: *Bold text*, _Italic text_, ~strike text~
